How it works: Citi's policy is surprisingly uncomplicated. Travel expenses are covered under an employee's health insurance, according to a source familiar with it.

* The company plan already covers people with, say, a heart condition who need treatment at a far-off hospital. This is no different. The benefit would extend to employees in any state where access is restricted.
* "Extending the benefit promotes more equitable access to health care services and supports women's health," the source said.
* Not only would travel expenses be reimbursed, but paid sick leave would cover any time off for an employee who needs to travel, get the procedure done and recover.
* Privacy shouldn't be an issue, the source said. Benefits are handled by an outside provider, so a woman's boss would have no reason to know details of her medical issue.
